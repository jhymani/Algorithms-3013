An AVL tree is a height, self-balancing binary search tree where, for every node, the heights of its two child subtrees differ by 1, 0, or -1, ensuring efficient operations like search, insertion, and deletion with a time complexity of O(log n). 

Operations on AVL Trees:

Insertion: When a node is inserted, the tree might become unbalanced. AVL trees use rotations to rebalance the tree and maintain the height-balanced property. 

Deletion: When a node is deleted, the tree might become unbalanced and rotations are used to rebalance. 

Rotations: Rotations are operations that rearrange the tree structure by rotating nodes. This maintains the height- balancing structure and the BST properties.

 There are four main types of rotations: Left-Left (LL), Right-Right (RR), Left-Right (LR), and Right-Left (RL).
