In this presentation The effect of 6-weeks of yoga training on measures of health and performance in sedentary individuals was about studying the effects fof yoga on non active people. I thought this presentation was intresting because many individuals do not see yoga as excercise but as a leisure activity. However yoga proved to be a beneficial excercise tthat has similar effects on the body like running on a treadmill.The study proved that yoga did decrease stress and anxiety in people who started doing yoga, but one of the most important finds was that people slept bettter and for longer. It also proved that people were breathing better too. This study encouraged me to  add yoga to my weekly schedule because of the many benefits associated with the practice.
