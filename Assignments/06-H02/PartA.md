Part A: Conceptual Questions

Define Hashing and Collision Resolution

What is a hash table and why is collision resolution necessary?

Explain the key differences between open hashing (chaining) and closed hashing (open addressing).

Collision Resolution Techniques


Briefly describe at least two methods for resolving collisions in open addressing (e.g., linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing).
Explain the pros and cons of each method.

Which collision resolution technique can handle more values than table slots. Explain.

What is the worst performance (big oh) for each type of collision resolution technique?
Impact of Hash Table Size


How does the choice of table size affect the distribution of keys?

What are the pitfalls of using a poor table size (for example, a table size that is a round number or a power of 2)?
