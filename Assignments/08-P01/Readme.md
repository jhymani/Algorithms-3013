## üìå Overview

The **Bellman-Ford algorithm** is a single-source shortest path algorithm used on weighted graphs. Unlike Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm, it can handle graphs **with negative edge weights** and can detect **negative weight cycles**, making it a powerful and flexible choice in certain graph problems.

## üìö Historical Background

* **Alfonso Shimbel** (1955): Introduced the earliest version.
* **Richard Bellman** (1956) and **Lester Ford Jr.** (1958): Independently proposed the formal algorithm.
* **Edward F. Moore** (1959): Introduced a notable variation.
* Sometimes referred to as the **Bellman-Ford-Moore Algorithm**.

## ‚úÖ Key Features

### Advantages

* Supports **negative weights**.
* **Detects negative cycles**.
* Simple to implement.
* Works with **directed or undirected** graphs.
* Early stopping improves efficiency.
* Ideal for **sparse** graphs (using edge list representation).

### Disadvantages

* **Time complexity**: `O(VE)` ‚Üí slower than Dijkstra for dense graphs.
* High space usage for large graphs.
* Inefficient for graphs with many edges.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization**
   Set all vertex distances to ‚àû except the source, which is 0.

2. **Edge Relaxation (V - 1 times)**
   For each edge (u ‚Üí v):
   If `dist[u] + weight < dist[v]`, update `dist[v]`.

3. **Negative Cycle Check**
   If further updates are possible, a **negative cycle exists**.

4. **Output**
   Return shortest distances and paths if no negative cycle is found.

## üß™ Working Example

Given graph:

```
A ‚Üí B (3)  
A ‚Üí C (4)  
C ‚Üí B (-2)  
B ‚Üí D (5)
```

**Iterations (V = 4, so 3 passes):**

* After 1st pass:
  `dist(A)=0, dist(B)=2, dist(C)=4, dist(D)=7`

* No changes in passes 2 & 3 ‚Üí early convergence.
